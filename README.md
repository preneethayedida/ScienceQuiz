## 💡 Why I Built This

I’m **Preneetha**, a passionate developer who never codes just for the sake of coding. I always choose *thought-provoking, unique, or culturally inspired topics* — projects that not only challenge my skills but also reflect my creative mindset.

> "Code is not just logic; it’s language, culture, and emotion coming together in pixels."

This quiz is a small yet vibrant example of how learning and design can beautifully coexist.
